<h1>Why does God's giving vary between people?</h1>

<p>God may not give us a complete answer to this question. Below are some thoughts about his provision of temporal and eternal gifts.</p>

<h2>God owns all things (including mankind)</h2>
<div class="verse">
  <p>The earth is the LORD's and the fullness thereof,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;the world and those who dwell therein,<br />
  for he has founded it upon the seas<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;and established it upon the rivers. (Psalm 24:1-2 ESV)</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
  <p>Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it. Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day. (Deuteronomy 10:14-15 ESV)</p>
</div>

<h2>Sinful Men are owed death</h2>

<div class="verse">
  <p>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23 ESV)</p>
  <p>Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them. (Romans 1:32 ESV)</p>
</div>

<h2>All we have is from God</h2>
<div class="verse">
  <p>John answered, “A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. (John 3:27 ESV)</p>
  <p>“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. (1 Chronicles 29:14
 ESV)</p>
</div>

<h2>God gives as he decides</h2>
<p>God, as creator and owner of all, is free to give (or not give) as he sees fit.</p>
<div class="verse">
  <p>And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. (Exodus 33:19b ESV)</p>
</div>

<h2>We don't always know why</h2>
<div class="verse">
  <p>“The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law. (Deuteronomy 29:29 ESV)</p>
  <p>Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!</p>
  <p>“For who has known the mind of the Lord,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;or who has been his counselor?”<br />
  “Or who has given a gift to him<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;that he might be repaid?”</p>
  <p>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. (Romans 11:33-36 ESV)</p>
</div>
<p>Since we are all owed death and hell, we might ask why God gives any good to any of us at all.</p>

<h2>We should respond with repentance</h2>
<div class="verse">
  <p>Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? (Romans 2:4 ESV)</p>
</div>

<h2>We always owe him worship</h2>
<p>Even if God takes all of our temporal gifts, we still owe him our worship.</p>
<div class="verse">
  <p>Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped. And he said, “Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.” (Job 1:20-21 ESV)</p>
</div>

<h2>Temporal gifts are relatively worthless</h2>
<p>And even if God did give us all things in this life, they'll be useless to us if we don't daily reject sin, trust in Christ's sin atoning sacrifice and rest in his obedience and righteousness.</p>
<div class="verse">
  <p>And he said to all, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself? (Luke 9:23-25 ESV)</p>
  <p>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. (2 Corinthians 5:21 ESV)</p>
</div>
