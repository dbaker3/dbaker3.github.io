    <h1>Quick Analysis of Roman Catholic Soteriology</h1>
    <p>Any person attempting to obtain salvation through faith and works is not saved from God’s wrath against their sin. The Apostle Paul makes this clear in his letter to the Galatians, where he rebukes the Judaizers and those who were giving regard to their teaching. I argue that those adhering to the Roman Catholic religion are, in essence, holding to the same heresy as that of the Judaizers in the early church.</p>
    <p>First, in Galatians 1:6-8, Paul makes it clear that the teaching of the Judaizers is not in accord with Christ’s gospel, “<sup>6</sup> I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— <sup>7</sup> not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. <sup>8</sup> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.”</p>
    <p>Justification, being counted righteous in God’s sight, is plainly by faith alone in Christ alone. Galatians 2:16 states, “yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.” This is essential to the Gospel.</p>
    <p>The error that Paul is counteracting in his letter to the Galatians shows up in Acts 15:1 where Luke notes that, “some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, ‘Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.’” The Judaizers were giving a condition, which must be kept in addition to faith in Christ, in order to be saved.</p>
    <p>To Paul, this adulterating of the gospel with law-keeping is absurd and destroying to the gospel, as seen in Galatians 3:2-3, “<sup>2</sup> Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? <sup>3</sup> Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?” The flesh cannot add anything to our justification. In fact, the attempt to do so proves that one is unregenerate, cursed, separate from Christ— essentially making a fruitless attempt at justifying themselves— “For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, ‘Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them’” (Galatians 3:10). Again, further in Galatians 5:2-4, “<sup>2</sup> Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. <sup>3</sup> I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. <sup>4</sup> You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.”</p>
    <p>If you are trusting in anything other than, or in addition to, Christ’s atoning death and righteousness imputed to you in order to be saved from God’s wrath, you are cut off from Christ. Peter, in Acts 4:12, makes it clear that there is no salvation apart from Christ, “And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” To be cut off from Christ is to be under God’s just and terrifying wrath.</p>
    <p>Now, the question must be answered whether or not Roman Catholics are relying on faith and works for their salvation. Are they adding more requirements to the sole condition of faith for a person’s justification before God? The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC), Paragraph 2010 states, “we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life.” I want to emphasize that the Roman Catholic religion states that we can merit for ourselves the graces needed for the attainment of eternal life. Rome explains the necessity of the Pope and bishops for teaching “the specific precepts of the natural law, because their observance, demanded by the Creator, is necessary for salvation” (CCC 2036), and that these false teachers (Gal. 5:7-12) must proclaim their errors “so that all men may attain salvation through faith, Baptism and the observance of the Commandments” (CCC 2068). Again, note Rome’s false conclusion that receiving baptism, and observing natural law and the Commandments, are necessary for a person’s salvation. These citations of Roman Catholic teaching are sufficient in demonstrating their participation in the same error as that of the Judaizers of the early church.</p>
