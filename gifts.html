<h1>Why does God's giving vary between people?</h1>

<p>God may not give us a complete answer to this question. But we can know these points:</p>

<h2>God owns all things (including mankind)</h2>
<p class="verse">The earth is the LORD's and the fullness thereof,<br />
&nbsp;the world and those who dwell therein,<br />
for he has founded it upon the seas<br />
&nbsp;and established it upon the rivers. (Psalm 24:1-2 ESV)</p>

<p class="verse">Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it. Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day. (Deuteronomy 10:14-15 ESV)</p>

<h2>Sinful Men are owed death</h2>

<p class="verse">For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23 ESV)</p>
<p class="verse">Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them. (Romans 1:32 ESV)</p>

<h2>All we do have is from God</h2>
<p class="verse">John answered, “A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. (John 3:27 ESV)</p>
<p class="verse">“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. (1 Chronicles 29:14
 ESV)</p>

<h2>God gives as he decides</h2>
Exodus 33:19b - And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. (ESV)

<h2>We don't always know why</h2>
Deuteronomy 29:29 - The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law. (ESV)
Romans 11:33-36 - Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord,	or who has been his counselor? Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid? For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. (ESV)

Since we are all owed death and hell, we might ask why God gives any good to any of us at all.
Exodus 34:6-9 - The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation. And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped. And he said, If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance. (ESV)
